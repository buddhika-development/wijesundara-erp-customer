The platform is architected around three core components to ensure scalability, security, and modular maintainability:

- **Customer and Supplier Portal**: Manages interactions with external suppliers and customers, allowing suppliers to place bids and submit stock availability directly.
- **Internal System Client**: Manages all internal operational interfaces used by staff and administrators.
- **Backend Server**: Handles all backend processing, data management, and API services.

By separating frontend and backend components, the system enhances security, optimizes performance, and allows each module to evolve independently.
